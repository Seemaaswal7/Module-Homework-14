1) The first graph reperesents SVM Model with short_window = 4 and  long_window = 100 and off set is by 3 months.
2) The 2nd graph graph reperesents SVM Model with short_window = 4 and  long_window = 100 and  off set is by 6 months
3) The 3rd graph represents SVM model tuned with the short_window = 10 and long_window = 200. Also the off set is by 3 months
4) The 4th graph represents Logistic Regression Model with short_window = 4 and  long_window = 100 and off set is by 3 months
5) The 5th graph represents Ada Boost Model with short_window = 4 and  long_window = 100 and off set is by 3 months

Out of all the 5 graphs I think the closest stratgey and actual match is in the 3rd grpah where the short window is 10 and long window is 2000 after tuning the svm model.
